# Binary Image Classification - Cats vs Dogs &middot;
> The program follows a similar structure as one demonstrated in fastai courses and classifies images as cats or dogs

The Project provides a step by step method to classify images in two categories and goes deeper into understanding parameters such as learning rate to improve the accuracy of the models developed. The project is an attempt to the Kaggle competition for Cats vs Dogs

## Installing / Getting started

You need to use fastai 0.7; please follow the installation instructions[here](https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastai-v0-install-issues-thread/24652)  .


## Developing

### Built With
fastai 0.7, sklearn libraries

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.
NVidia GPU with programming framework CUDA is helpful for training and testing the models

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

Set the PATH variable to your relavant folder location
```shell
git https://github.com/anandpuntambekar/Binary_Image_Classiff_cats_dogs.git
cd Binary_Image_Classiff_cats_dogs/
```


## Style guide

The notebook is well commented explaining in technical details each and every step of the process end to end
